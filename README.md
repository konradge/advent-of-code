# Repository for advent-of-code 2023

Here are my solutions to [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) written in python. The solution for one day can be run using:

```sh
python3 main.py <day> [--verbose]
```

where \<day\> is the number of the day for which the solution shall be run.
Optionally set --verbose to get the runtime of the solution.
